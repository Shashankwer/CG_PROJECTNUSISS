Tourism is one of the major sources of entertainment during all times. Singaporeâ€™s economy receives a major contribution from the tourism industry. According to the facts stated by the Singapore tourism board, it is the fifth most visited place in the world and second in Asia-pacific. Additionally, there were about 18.5 million visitors in 2018 from which it can be inferred that there has been an increase in the count by 6.7 percent since 2017. Most of the Tourist visits are limited to some popular region like Singapore Safar, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens By The Bay Sands.  

Tourism in Singapore is limited to few of the places while Singapore has so many things right from locations, Cusines, Shops, in most of the baised visits to Singapore many places remain unexplored. Many of such places are in vicinity where New Tourists stay. Many of these would match their interest but still remain unkown to the tourists.    

This project proposes and implements a cognitive chat bot system that proposes an alterative solution to issues noted above. The chat bot is called Yellow Pages bot, which draws inspiration from Yellow Pages which had a directory of every thing few years back. The chat bot aims to be a travel companion which can provide information in and around location. This bot aims to suggest Attractions, Restaurants, Shops in vicinity of any area in Singapore and in turn help discover some new places of interest. The system aims to use Natural language based query to suggest places to the user based on the interest. This also allows user to search near any location or district in Singapore. With this as your constant assistant you'll always find new places around and make your trip more memorable.
